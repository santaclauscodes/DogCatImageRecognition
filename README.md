# DogCatImageRecognition
Use a CNN Neural Network to determine whether an image is a Dog or a Cat

This project works with the kaggle contest that has 15000 images and requires a ML program to recognize whether 
the image is a dog or a cat.

One of the challenges of working with this assignment is working efficiently with such a large number of images and image files.

I am not uploading these images to Kaggle, but have them stored on a Google Drive.

The included Juypter Notebook contains the code I used to process these images and get a fairly decent score on Kaggle.

The Kaggle contest can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition

I have also included an image of the CNN model created by this process to do the dog cat image recongnition.
